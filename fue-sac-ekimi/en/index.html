                                    procedure and compare the operations.

                                <h2 class="excert-header">What Happened Before FUE?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">Before FUE, the main method of follicle extraction was follicular unit
                                    transplantation (FUT or FUSS). In FUT method, surgeons have to make an incision
                                    around the head. The incision ranges from behind one ear to another around the
                                    occipital part of the scalp. After taking the strip of skin, the surgeon sutures the
                                    ends of skin together. This method of hair transplantation is quite outdated now,
                                    and most surgeons abandoned this procedure.</p>

                                <h2 class="excert-header">FUE Transplant Workflow </h2>
                                <p class="excert">During FUE hair transplant, multiple personnel work at the same time
                                    throughout the operation. They share the work to speed up the process.
                                <ul class="excert-list">
                                    <li class="excert-list">After the selected follicles are grafted with the micromotor
                                        operators, start extracting follicles with a tweezer. Meanwhile, another
                                        operator cleans and sorts the grafts in the background. </li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">To clean the grafts, another operator first takes the
                                        collected follicle and lines them up on a strip of surgical gauze. </li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">Then the operator takes a bottle of spray and squirts it on
                                        the grafts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Hair follicles do not survive for long outside our body. That’s why, after the grafts
                                are clean; we put them into a serum solution.
                                <ul class="excert-list">

                                        8-10 hours outside the body.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">All the while, hair transplant operations usually take less
                                        than 8 hours in total.</li>

                                <p class="excert">Throughout the operation, operators will anaesthetise you at least two
                                    times. You will get your first administration of anaesthesia right before the
                                    extraction process.
                                <ul class="excert-list">
                                    <li class="excert-list">The doctor draws a line around the occipital area.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">The line will begin from your nape and extend around behind
                                        the ears.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">The line ends at your crown area, and this area has the most

                                <p class="excert">
                                    The anaesthesia may hurt a bit at the moment of administration. When the anaesthesia

                                    the donor area is complete, patients often stop having sensation around areas that
                                    got
                                    anaesthetised first. Therefore, you will not feel anything during the operation.
                                </p>

                                    After the extraction and right before opening the canals, you will get your second

                                    will
                                    draw a line. For this time, it will be around the area that is going to get
                                    implantations. <br>
                                    Some patients also opt for hair grafting from under the beard and chest too. In this
                                    case, the same procedure applies to these parts as well.

                                <h2 class="excert-header">How Do We Determine Where The Grafts Go?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">When the dissection and clean up are complete, the physician prepares
                                    to open canals.
                                <ul class="excert-list">
                                    <li class="excert-list">Canals are tiny holes physicians punch with microblades.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">The physician assesses the hair’s natural growth patterns
                                        and draws a pathway
                                        accordingly.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">Our hair tends to grow inclined to a certain angle. That’s
                                        why they don’t just
                                        stick out with a 90-degree angle.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">So the operator looks at the natural angles and makes
                                        incisions to resemble
                                        these angles.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">The operator who lines up the grafts also counts how many
                                        grafts are harvested
                                        from the patient.</li>
                                    <li class="excert-list">Physician plans the number of canals according to the

                                    <li class="excert-list">So the physician determines where to put more canals and how
                                        much coverage which

                                    <li class="excert-list">The physician opens canals to match the number of grafts.

                                But moving for a long time can become uncomfortable. That’s why teams take a small break
                                to give the patient some time off after opening the canals.

                                <h2 class="excert-header">Sapphire FUE Hair Transplant</h2>
                                <p class="excert">Thanks to advancing technology, we can now make blades off the
                                    sapphire mineral.

                                    Sapphire is a precious gem. What makes sapphire FUE hair transplant special is the
                                    hardness of the material. Metal tools start going blunt after a certain amount of
                                    punctures and lose their sharpness. This is because metals can bend. Minerals such
                                    as sapphire, on the other hand, do not bend or lose sharpness. With sapphire hair
                                    transplants, doctors can open canals with higher precision.
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="excert-header">The Implantation Process</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    Now that both the grafts and the canals are ready, the implantation
                                    process can begin. After the break, the operators each take a collection of grafts
                                    and start the implantation process. The grafts judged to be more healthy, often go
                                    into the front line of the canals. <br>

                                    Operators take each graft with a very small tool resembling a tweezer. Usually, two
                                    or more operators implant hair follicles simultaneously to gain time. Frequently,
                                    this phase takes up most of the time during the operation since each graft is
                                    delicate, and they need attention when planting. <br>


                                    Sometimes during this phase, anaesthetics may wear off. You should inform the team
                                    if you start to feel something. If you did not take too many anaesthetics during the
                                    operation, they would give you more anaesthesia.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="excert-header">What About FUT Method?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    FUT method came a decade before FUE and thus, the FUE and DHI methods have some
                                    things they do better than FUT. Years of development in the field of medicine and
                                    medicinal equipment allowed a different approach to hair transplantation.<br>

                                    FUE and FUT methods have a reasonably similar implantation phase (DHI is a bit
                                    different though). Towards the end, the physician comes and opens canals for
                                    implantation. Then the rest of the team starts implantation with the same tool
                                    resembling a tweezer.<br>

                                </p>

                                <h2 class="excert-header">What Is Different In the FUE Operation?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    The main difference between the two is how they approach to taking grafts. As we
                                    said, the physician slits a strip out and uses this to create grafts. In FUE and DHI
                                    surgeries, however, physicians do not open any incisions.<br>

                                    In FUE and DHI hair transplantation operators use an electrical device called
                                    micromotor. These devices have a high torque motor built inside, and they have a
                                    round tip called punch. This punch opens tiny holes around the hair follicles that
                                    we are going to graft. <br>
                                    The size of the punch varies according to the patient’s follicle type. The radius of
                                    the punch usually falls somewhere from .6cm to .9cm. Bigger punches exist, but they
                                    are not used as often. <br>
                                    If the patient has very curly hair, a bigger punch may be necessary. Because curly
                                    hair follicles usually tend to be curly themselves. Using a small punch on this kind
                                    of hair may lead to damages on the follicle.
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="excert-header">The Extraction Process in FUE Hair Transplant</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    After the operator using the micromotor covers a certain area, another operator
                                    steps in and begins the harvest. The micromotor punches very small holes, but that
                                    is about all it does. We also need to extract the follicles individually. The
                                    operator in charge of the harvest uses the same tweezer-like tool to take out
                                    grafts. This time, we have single follicle grafts right off the bat. Again, another
                                    operator takes these grafts and cleans them with the help of a spray bottle. After
                                    follicles are clean, the operator sorts and count them just like in FUT. <br>

                                    In FUT procedure, patients get a big permanent scar at the back of their head.
                                    Often, this scar is not visible unless the patients have their hair short. However,
                                    due to these reasons, we recommend our patients FUE and DHI methods rather than the
                                    FUT method.<br>
                                    In FUE procedure, however, there is no need for any incisions. Micromotor handles
                                    the extraction with minimal damage to the scalp skin. Thanks to this minimally
                                    invasive tool, patients do not get permanent scars. After all, tiny holes heal
                                    pretty well compared to surgical incisions. Micromotor extraction scars are almost
                                    invisible to the naked eye even when the hair is cut short. <br>
                                    In the past, clinics did FUE extractions by a handheld mechanical device. Today we
                                    do this with a micromotor. Though, handheld devices were more popular during the

                                    Both surgery types offer reliable results when it comes to coverage. FUE and DHI
                                    methods do not cause this scarring, that’s why they are much more popular currently.
                                    Actually, seeing FUT operations done on patients is quite rare nowadays.<br>

                                    In FUE and DHI, we extract follicles homogeneously from all around the donor area.
                                    This way, we don’t overharvest areas and cause a patchy look after the operation. In
                                    FUT, however, we used to remove a strip of hair-bearing skin right away. Today, it
                                    is not as efficient as the other methods.<br>

                                    In FUE and DHI, patients do not get permanent scars. This is a major advantage of
                                    these operations. When you consult us, our experts will help you with any of these
                                    methods.

                                    After FUE hair transplant is complete, the team sits you up and starts bandaging
                                    you. The recipient zone does not get bandaged. Because at this point, the implanted
                                    grafts are too sensitive to withstand any physical contact. Thus, you must pay extra

                                    When you wake up the next morning, you will need to take some medications. We will
                                    give you these medications after the operation. Of course, you will get information
                                    about how you will use them along with the medications. <br>
                                    And when your operation is complete, we will also give you a check-up time. When you
                                    come to our clinic, we will remove your bandaging, clean up your head and give you a
                                    headband. After the operation, some inflammation happens. This is a result of the
                                    operation and the medication. Your body will accumulate fluids as a first-line
                                    response to injuries and foreign agents (anaesthetic).

                                    Due to gravity, the headband helps keep these fluids from travelling downwards. If
                                    these fluids are to travel downwards, they usually end up on the patient’s face.
                                    This creates an unpleasant look and sometimes mild discomfort. So follow your
                                    doctor’s instructions and keep the band on as long as specified. <br>
                                    Furthermore, not employing a good posture after the surgery may lead to the same
                                    result. You may put yourself at risk if you are used to bending your neck and
                                    looking down. We advise patients to keep their posture as good as possible to avoid
                                    such complications. The inflammation resolves around 3-7 days, depending on how the
                                    patient’s body responds.

                                    Having hair transplantation in Europe or America costs around 4000 to 14000 Euros.

                                    The truth is, Turkey has been getting more and more popular among international
                                    patients. The quality of service and price are the main reasons behind this rise in
                                    popularity. Doctors saw the potential of offering the exact same quality of hair
                                    transplantation service as clinics in developed countries. <br>
                                    Doctors realised they could operate clinics with a much smaller overhead. Therefore,
                                    more and more doctors invest in opening state of the art clinics as the popularity
                                    rises. These clinics are mainly based in Istanbul. <br>
                                    Many people who choose to have a hair transplant operation in Turkey also stay for
                                    longer. As the cost of FUE hair transplantation in Turkey is quite affordable, many
                                    people consider this as an operation plus holiday package. <br>
                                    In most cases, patients can return to work 3-7 days after the operation, provided
                                    they do not do heavy physical work. Still, many patients judge that they could use a
                                    holiday in Turkey and stay a bit longer. For more information, you can simply get in
