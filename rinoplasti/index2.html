                                    Rhinoplasty is a nose reshaping and restructuring surgery. The aim is to make the nose functionally and aesthetically better. The nose is an organ located in the center of the face and plays a very significant role in facial appearance. Each nose has
                                    a unique shape. Even small changes in the nose can affect the facial aesthetics. People often want to have rhinoplasty surgery to regain the ideal nose shape. The harmony between generally accepted proportions and parts
                                    of the face can be the key to a beautiful look. Although it is accepted that many people with an attractive appearance have harmony in their faces, it is not possible to talk about a standard of beauty adopted by all
                                    people. One of the most important benefits of the pre-operative interview is to reveal the patient's expectations and how much the surgeon can meet these expectations. Patients generally act according to their own perception
                                    of beauty, which is developed with social, cultural, social, etc. influences, and they have an instinctive view of what a beautiful nose should look like. The surgeon has a difficult task: to create a nose that the
                                    patient, the society, and the surgeon himself will appreciate. The surgeon determines the points that the rhinoplasty candidate takes into consideration and tries to understand whether the patient has realistic expectations
                                    or unusual views and to determine the deformities that need to be corrected in the nose before surgery. In doing so, he considers personal judgments, specific rules, proportions, angles, and geometric relationships.
                                    The structure of cartilages, existing traces; evaluates the age, gender, and skin character of the patient. He prepares the surgery plan as a result of aesthetic and anatomical evaluations and chooses the appropriate
                                    technique for this plan in order for the patient to have an ideal nose.

                                <h2 class="excert-header">Anatomy</h2>
                                <p class="excert">The fact that the nose is in the middle of the face in both horizontal and vertical, has made it the center of attraction. The nose consists of the skin, subcutaneous, muscles, bone-cartilage skeleton, and mucosa, respectively,
                                    from the outside to the inside. Inside the nose, there is a wall of cartilage and bone called the midline septum. On the outer walls, there are functional structures called concha that heat and humidify the breathing
                                    air. Skin thickness is one of the most major factors determining rhinoplasty results. The bone-cartilage skeleton changes during surgery. It shows all the changes under the thin skin, but thick skin can prevent the
                                    changes from being seen. Medium skin thickness is best for a better result.</p>

                                    Ameliyatın ana amacı yüzünüzle uyumlu doğal ve daha iyi görünen bir burun oluşturmaktır. Her ameliyat daha iyi sonuç almak için yapılır fakat her ameliyattan mükemmel sonuç beklemek gerçekçi değildir. Ameliyatın sonucu sadece cerrahın yeteneğine ve deneyimine
                                    bağlı değildir. Hastanın yaşı, genel sağlık durumu, cilt durumu, kemik iskeleti, sigara içme, yara iyileşmesi ve anatomik yapısı ile de ilgilidir.

                                <p class="excert">
                                    Rhinoplasty is a surgery that is generally requested by young adults between the ages of 18 and 35 and can be successfully applied until the age of 50s and 60s. In cases where nasal congestion is advanced, surgery can be performed at an earlier age.

                                    Evet, rinoplasti ameliyatı kolay bir ameliyat değildir. Rinoplasti yüz estetik ameliyatlarının zor olanlarındandır. Her yüzün kendine ait benzersiz karakteristiğine meydan okunur. Burun fonksiyonunu korurken ya da onarırken, yüzün bireyselliğine uygun

                                    It is very important to protect the physiological functions of the nose while obtaining an aesthetic nose. In other words, the highly important functions of the nose should not be sacrificed for aesthetic appearance. Under normal conditions, rhinoplasty
                                    does not cause nasal congestion. The nasal septum divides the nose into two equal parts and forms the main support mechanism. Septum deviation can occur due to genetic reasons or trauma. In addition, the enlargement
                                    of the concha arising from the lateral nasal wall can cause respiratory problems. The mucous membrane covering the inside of the nose can grow and swell due to allergies and smoking. All these reasons may cause nasal
                                    congestion in the patient. In this respect, patients should be examined, and the examination findings should be explained to the patient. All obstructive causes should be corrected during surgery because after rhinoplasty,
                                    the air passage narrows by 10-20%.

                                    Each surgeon takes a different path to show the estimated results of the surgery. Mirrors, hand-made drawings, natural-sized photographs, and computer programs can be used for this purpose. The computer environment provides an environment where the patient
                                    and the surgeon can share their ideas and agree on expectations and results. The image on the computer cannot give a definite and guaranteed result regarding the postoperative situation. This should be known to patients.

                                <p class="excert">
                                    There are two main approaches in rhinoplasty: Endonasal (closed) and external (open) approach. In the endonasal approach, all incisions are made through the nose, so there is no scar on the skin. The external approach has become a popular approach due
                                    to the advantages it brings. In this approach, a V-shaped incision is made through the narrowest part of the nostrils. This method, which does not leave a visible scar, is preferred by 90% of doctors. It is possible
                                    to obtain good results with the endonasal approach performed by experienced surgeons. As a result, which approach will be preferred is entirely related to the surgeon and does not cause any negative effects for the
                                    patient.

                                <h2 class="excert-header">What should I avoid before the surgery?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    The most important thing is to avoid taking aspirin and similar drugs that can cause bleeding. You can use paracetamol or acetaminophen if you have pain. Do not smoke because nicotine impairs the blood circulation, affecting wound healing. Have your blood
                                    tests, EKG and lung film. Do not drink alcohol for a few days before and a few weeks after surgery because it causes congestion and bleeding.
                                </p>



                                <h2 class="excert-header">How will the surgery be done?</h2>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    It can be performed under local anesthesia, under sedation or under general anesthesia, depending on the preference of the patient and the doctor. The surgery may take between 1 hour and 6 hours depending on the current nasal deformity. The surgeon should
                                    have explained the changes he plans to make to the patient in detail. The septum deviation (the curvature of the wall in the middle of the nose) is corrected, followed by the incisions that can be made endonasal or
                                    externally, then the operation is started. This process is functionally substantial. After the septum deviation is corrected, all deformities are corrected one by one according to the plan made before the operation.
                                    If there is a hump (arch) on the back of the nose, it is removed, the irregularities are eliminated, if necessary, the bone side walls of the nose are broken and the opening on the back of the nose is closed. Interventions
                                    are made for the cartilages at the tip of the nose. The cartilages obtained from the septum are used to make various corrections during surgery, to support the tissues or to give the desired shape. If the patient has
                                    had another nose surgery and there is not enough cartilage in the nose, these cartilages can also be obtained from the ear or rib. The initial incisions made are sutured and closed. A buffer can be placed in the nose.
                                    Some surgeons may use special buffers to reduce the discomfort caused by the leakage that may occur immediately after surgery. The back of the nose is protected by plaster or special molds and the operation is terminated.

                                        Rhinoplasty is an operation with predictable results. The nose is a dynamic organ, and the surgeon can predict the shape of the nose after wound healing and in the long term. The surgeon examines the patient at regular intervals according to the patient's
                                        needs, more often in the first 3 weeks. Routine follow-up protocol is to check the patient on the 6th week, 3rd month, 6th month, 1st year and then once a year. With this protocol, the patient and the surgeon can
                                        evaluate the results of the surgery together.
