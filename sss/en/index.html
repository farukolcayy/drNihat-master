                                            operation. "When can I start sports after nasal aesthetics?" The question
                                            can vary quite a bit. Returning to sports life varies according to the
                                            sport.

                                            it will be beneficial because of the edema reduction feature of the calm
                                            walks. It is recommended 6 weeks after the operation as it will
                                            speed up your breathing for returning to high-paced walking.</p>
                                        <h4>Return to Run </h4>
                                        <p>For running, it can be said that it is suitable for 6 weeks after the
                                            operation. To increase the tempo, first make sure that you do not feel the
                                            pressure in your head. If it's okay, nothing can hold you back.</p>

                                            should swim carefully and calmly. Trauma may occur in the nose in situations
                                            such as jumping.</p>
                                        <h4>Return to Fitness, Pilates and Yoga</h4>
                                        <p>It is deemed appropriate after 6 weeks for Pilates and yoga, and 3 months
                                            later to start sports such as fitness where the whole body is in motion or
                                            with high weights. Especially with fitness, it will be beneficial
                                            to wait for a while if an increase in pressure and edema on the face is
                                            felt.

                                        <p>The biggest danger in team sports played with the ball in this style is the
                                            ball hit to the nose. Avoiding this is very important. If you are careful,
                                            you can return after 4 months. In case of an increase in edema
                                            in your nose, it will be useful to wait for a while.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> For sports other than those mentioned above, a return can be made after 6
                                            weeks, considering the intensity of body use and the possibility of impact.
                                            The critical point for all sports performed after rhinoplasty
                                            is to be careful.</p>

                                        <h4>Confidence</h4>
                                        <p>Both the environment and the staff in the clinic you prefer should gain your
                                            trust and should not let you down in case of a negative situation. It will
                                            give confidence to ask for pictures of your doctor's former
                                            patients.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Simulation Program </h4>
                                        <p>We recommend that you choose a clinic that uses a simulation program.
                                            Because, thanks to this program, an approximate image can be obtained after
                                            surgery. This approximate image can give you an idea and helps the
                                            doctor to understand your style.</p>

                                        <h4>When Does the Final Shape Fit After Nose Aesthetics?</h4>
                                        <p>It is very natural that some swelling and slight bruises occur after your
                                            aesthetic operation. These should not worry you before seeing your final
                                            result. In the first 3 days, you will have swelling on your face
                                            and at the end of the third day, your swelling will decrease rapidly.
                                            Although bruising is not expected much, it usually resolves after 5 to 7
                                            days. Depend on the difference from skin to skin, you can return
                                            to your normal life at the end of 2-3 weeks. The time that can be predicted
                                            for your nose to fit properly is roughly 1 year. During this time period,
                                            diet, sleep patterns and abundant fluid consumption will
                                            shorten the time.

                                        <p>A newly operated nose should not be exposed to the sun directly. We recommend
                                            that you use 50 factor sunscreen on your face before going out in the sun
                                            for the first 6 weeks.</p>
                                        <p>We recommend that you swim 4 weeks after the operation because sea water will

                                        <p>The buffer application, which seems frightening in the society after
                                            rhinoplasty operations, is a material placed to stop bleeding, which is very
                                            natural after the operation. </p>
                                        <p>In today's article, we will talk about what buffer application is and why it
                                            is nothing to worry about.</p>

                                        <h4>So Why Use Buffer?</h4>
                                        <p>The main purpose of the buffer is to prevent adhesions in the nose after the
                                            operation, to minimize the bleeding that may occur by applying pressure and
                                            to maintain the shape.</p>

                                        <p>Cloth buffers, which are the reason for the fear of buffers, have not been
                                            used for years, the new generation silicone supports produced with the
                                            developing technology are designed to facilitate breathing and do
                                            not cause pain when removed. Considering all these reasons, the use of
                                            silicone support is both a necessary and a very painless method.</p>
                                        <p>Removal period of nasal packing which made of silicone is 3 days after the
                                            operation. </p>
                                        <h4>After silicone support;</h4>
                                        <p>When you go in front of the mirror after the buffer and nasal splint are
                                            removed, you will probably see swelling and edema. There may be slight
                                            swelling not only on your nose but also on your face. You will need
                                            2 to 3 weeks for these swelling to heal.</p>
                                        <p>Likewise, your nose can be very upright, which is due to the nasal splint and
                                            silicone supports. This will get better after 2-3 weeks.</p>
                                        <p>Being aware of this information will make you feel more comfortable after
                                            surgery.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Your nose will reach the final result in a period of 9 months to 1.5 years.

                                        <h4>Recovery Process After Nose Surgery</h4>
                                        <p>The process up to 1 year after your rhinoplasty operation is called the
                                            healing process.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>What should be considered after nose surgery?</h4>
                                        <p>There are some points that you should pay attention to from the moment you
                                            have your nose aesthetic operation.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>First, we can start with the lying position. Having your head higher than
                                            your body will reduce the occurrence of swelling. </p>
                                        <p>Applying ice significantly prevents swelling and bruises, especially during
                                            the post-operative period until discharge.</p>
                                        <p>You can drink water and eat 4 hours after the operation. Fatty and heavy
                                            meals should not be preferred for the first meal. </p>

                                        <h4>After Discharge from hospital;</h4>
                                        <p>Until the nasal splint is removed, your head should be higher than your body
                                            in the same way at home.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There is no harm in taking a shower, but you should wash your hair so that no
                                            water gets into your nose. It is recommended not to get water on your face
                                            for the first week.</p>
                                        <p>You should have a balanced and regular diet and avoid heavy foods. Abundant
                                            water consumption is recommended to prevent edema.</p>
                                        <h4>After Nasal Splint and Silicone supports are removed;</h4>
                                        <p>The most important factor is the nasal spray. Because the nose cannot
                                            moisturize itself for 6 weeks after the rhinoplasty operation. We recommend
                                            nasal sprays for 2 months. We recommend that you spray at least 10
                                            times a day for the first 2 weeks and then 3 times a day. In addition, we
                                            recommend that you use the medicines given by your doctor regularly.</p>
                                        <p>The touches you make to your nose should be soft, you should not behave hard.
                                            Blowing up, standing upside down, carrying heavy loads can increase the risk
                                            of bleeding, you should avoid them.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Glasses should not be worn for 3 months.</li>
                                            <li>You should come to your doctor's check-ups and not delay. </li>
                                            <li>You should avoid getting hit to the head.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Nutrition After Rhinoplasty?</h4>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>After your operation, you should avoid heavy fatty foods and increase
                                                the protein ratio in your diet in order to accelerate body regeneration.
                                            </li>

                                        <p>Deviation is the skewness of the nose bone. It is a situation that causes
                                            some problems. In this article, we can explain how a healthy nose structure
                                            should be before explaining exactly what deviation is.</p>
                                        <p>In a healthy nasal structure, two separate air inlets are also widening
                                            towards the back. This expanding section ensures that the incoming air is
                                            heated, humidified and sent to the olfactory area. In addition, particles
                                            larger than 5 microns taken with air are held and filtered with the help of
                                            mucoid secretions on the mucous membrane of the nose. Thus, the air
                                            transferred to the lungs becomes clean and of a certain quality.
                                            The health of our respiratory and lungs is related to the quality of the air
                                            taken.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The area we call the septum in the nose is a cartilage and bone structure
                                            that divides the nose into two air inlets, located in the middle of the
                                            nostrils and extending to the nasal area. In the deviated nose, this
                                            structure is not where it should be. His midline stance may be more or less
                                            leaning to the side. Nasal bone skew, which causes problems in the air flow,
                                            basically prevents air flow.

                                        <h4>Why Does Deviation Occur?</h4>
                                        <p>Deviation can occur due to hereditary characteristics or due to asymmetrical
                                            face shapes. In addition, deviation may occur as a result of external blows
                                            to the nose in the later stages of life, which can usually
                                            be in childhood or in adolescence. Nose development continues until the age
                                            of 16 in women and 17 in men. Take a blow to the nose during childhood can
                                            cause 1 millimeter slippage. If these shifts are not taken
                                            into account, the shifts continue to grow as the nose structure develops.
                                            </h4>
                                        <p>Deviation can cause many problems as it affects a vital situation such as
                                            breathing. We can list the problems caused by nasal deviation as follows;
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>With nasal congestion, the person breathes through the mouth. Therefore,
                                                the air is not heated and humidified like in the nose, and the quality
                                                of the air going to the lung decreases. This causes problems

                                            <li>Because of poor quality air, organs such as throat, larynx and lungs
                                                strive to make the air quality. This can cause reactions.</li>

                                            <li>As the breathing quality decreases, the quality of sleep also decreases,
                                                and the order is disrupted.</li>

                                            the mouth. There are some downsides to mouth breathing. We can list these

                                        <h4>What are the Symptoms of Deviation?</h4>
                                        <p>Deviation is a problem that can be seen from outside of the nose. Nasal bone
                                            curvature manifests itself in this way. However, in some cases, some
                                            symptoms occur in the nose. We can convey these symptoms as follows;</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Double or unilateral nasal congestion.</li>
                                            <li>Oral breathing.</li>
                                            <li>Sleeping with mouth open. </li>
                                            <li>Sleep apnea and snoring.</li>
                                            <li>Tiredness.</li>
                                            <li>Continuous recurrence of sinus infection.</li>
                                            <li>Pain in the nose and middle part of the face.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h4>Process Before Deviation Surgery </h4>
                                        <p>You will be informed about the healing process you can experience before the
                                            deviation surgery. The things you need to know about the positive and
                                            negative aspects of the surgery. The compulsory tests to be
                                            done are completed.</p>
                                        <h4>How is Deviation Surgery Performed?</h4>
                                        <p>Deviation surgery is a type of surgery that can be performed under general or
                                            local anesthesia. After anesthesia, an incision is made inside the patient's
                                            nose and the cartilage membrane is reached through this
                                            incision. The membrane is removed. Trapezoid cartilages are removed. It is
                                            extremely important to protect the nasal supports while these cartilages are
                                            taken out.</p>
                                        <h4>After Deviation Surgery </h4>
                                        <p>Edema and bruises are not expected on the face after deviation surgery. On
                                            the 3rd day, after the silicone supports are taken, the patient can return
                                            to his/her normal life. A total of 6-8 weeks of nasal sprays
                                            and intranasal moisturizers help the nose to regain its former functions.

                                            performed against various breathing problems. In such operations, the
                                            primary goal is to optimize the breathing function, and shape corrections
                                            can also be made if the patient wishes. If the individual has both deformity
                                            and breathing problems, cosmetic rhinoplasty and functional rhinoplasty can

                                        <h4>What is Nasal Valve Stenosis? What are the reasons?</h4>
                                        <p>Nasal Valve stenosis can be explained as the narrow nostrils. A narrow nasal
                                            entrance brings with it breathing problems. Nasal Valve, which is a problem
                                            that causes functional rhinoplasty, is usually caused by chronic
                                            causes, trauma, nasal concha size or incorrect rhinoplasty.</p>
                                        <h4>How to Understand Nasal Valve Stenosis?</h4>
                                        <p>Problems that cause functional rhinoplasty usually occur during sleep time.
                                            Lack of rest, snoring, oral problems caused by mouth breathing and nasal
                                            congestion are symptoms of nasal valve problem. Early fatigue
                                            is also observed because it causes breathing problems. If you have some of
                                            these symptoms, it is useful to consult your doctor. One of the most
                                            critical signs that you are experiencing a Nasal Valve problem
                                            is the collapse of the nasal corners while breathing deeply, sticking to the
                                            nasal bone.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>How is Nose Valve Surgery Performed?</h4>
                                        <p>The most definitive and permanent solution to get rid of this situation in
                                            your nose is to undergo a small operation. The weak spots that collapse into
                                            it are strengthened with cartilages, thus preventing the collapse.
                                            At the same time, if there are factors that cause stenosis, they are
                                            eliminated. In this procedure, which is an example of functional
                                            rhinoplasty, your nose shape is not intervened at all, or reshaping can be
                                            done if you wish. The only goal at the end of this operation is to reveal a
                                            nose where the patient can breathe more easily.</p>

                                        <h4>Criteria for the Best Rhinoplasty</h4>
                                        <p>There are some factors that should be considered when evaluating the
                                            rhinoplasty operation. First, the aesthetic nose is subjective, since
                                            personal tastes may vary, but when we look at it from a functional
                                            perspective,
                                            there is no subjective. A nose that is good in terms of functionality is a
                                            nose that can breathe easily and has correct canal angles. In order to say
                                            that nasal aesthetics is good, some criteria should be considered.
                                            We have mentioned some of them below.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>1. The nose should keep its shape years after surgery.</h4>

                                        <p>The most valuable parameter showing how successful the rhinoplasty operation
                                            is that it does not distort its shape for a long time (lifelong). The nose,
                                            which can maintain the shape it looks like during the operation
                                            for a long time, is one of the best nasal features.</p>

                                        <h4>2. Nose Tip</h4>

                                        <p>When we make a comparison, women generally want noses with a more angled tip
                                            than men. It is known in the society that the angle between the nose tips
                                            and lips of women is desired between 95-105 degrees. 90-95 degrees
                                            are the desired angles for men. For these reasons, the angle of your nose
                                            tip with your lips is a good place in our nose list.

                                        <h4>3. Personal Appropriateness of Rhinoplasty</h4>

                                        <p>The noses are all different from each other. Since everyone's face is unique.
                                            She/He will tell you which nose preferences are suitable for you during your
                                            meeting with your doctor. Since the nose shapes are suitable
                                            for face types, sometimes the nose of your dreams will never fit on your
                                            face, it will have worse results than the current situation. Therefore, the
                                            personal suitability of nasal aesthetics is in our list of
                                            criteria for a good nose.</p>
                                        <h4>4. Naturalness</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            The best noses are always the most natural. One of the factors to be
                                            considered in order not to encounter a very fake and irrelevant nose after
                                            your operation is naturalness.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>5. Personal Perception of Beauty</h4>
                                        <p>The perception of beauty is personal. If we are going to include the concept
                                            of beauty when making the best nose, this cannot be separated from
                                            subjectivity. A nose that is beautiful to you may not look good to
                                            someone else. The important point here is that the individual feels
                                            beautiful and is able to get what they want. A beautiful nose is a good nose
                                            if it stays beautiful for a long time. The other criterion of
                                            our list of the best noses cannot be separated from beauty for this reason.

                                        <h4>6. Functionality</h4>
                                        <p>Although you only want nasal aesthetics, you should want it to be able to
                                            perfectly meet the functional requirements of the resulting nose. As a
                                            result, the aesthetic satisfaction of a nose that cannot breathe will
                                            never be enough, on the contrary, it will force you to have revision
                                            rhinoplasty again. A good functional nose is the last member of our list.

                                        <h4>What Are the Risks?</h4>
                                        <p>There are always some risks in surgical interventions. The biggest reason for
                                            these is the risks arising from anesthesia. With the tests and analyzes
                                            performed, you can minimize these risks and have a smooth operation.
                                            The point that should not be forgotten is to inform your doctor about your
                                            illnesses. Notifying your doctor about all kinds of illnesses without
                                            thinking about what might have to do with it allows you to easily
                                            avoid the risks.</p>
                                        <p>First of all, the first risk that is feared to be encountered is the scarring
                                            of surgery. However, with the developing technology, sewing processes have
                                            much less risk of scarring.</p>
                                        <p>There are also some risks related to age. For instance, a possible nose
                                            operation in individuals younger than 16 years in women and 17 in men may
                                            cause nasal deformities with their development that has not yet been
                                            completed. Therefore, we warn individuals under the age of 16 not to have
                                            nasal aesthetics unless they are in a very difficult situation.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, as we mentioned in our article, what should be done before the
                                            operation, smoking and alcohol should be avoided for at least 6 months and
                                            blood thinners such as aspirin should be stopped at least 10
                                            days in advance.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When we pay attention to all these factors, you can eliminate the risks and
                                            pass your operation safely. The point we need to make is to be open and
                                            honest with the doctor. If there is no genetic disease, we can
                                            eliminate the obstacles to the operation.</p>
                                        <h4>Inconvenient Diseases for Nose Rhinoplasty?</h4>
                                        <h5>Heart disease </h5>
                                        <p>Today, the developing health sector has made nasal aesthetics possible for
                                            some diseases. People with heart disease are the leading ones. With
                                            different anesthesia methods, cardiac patients can also have rhinoplasty.
                                            You should definitely consult your heart doctor and eliminate the risks with
                                            the necessary tests and analyzes.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Diabetes</h5>
                                        <p>There is no obstacle for diabetic patients to undergo rhinoplasty operation,
                                            but the point to be known is that the healing process of the wounds takes
                                            longer than normal in diabetic patients. At the same time, the
                                            body is less resistant to the risk of infection. These risks can be
                                            eliminated, but you should pay attention to your doctor's instructions and
                                            follow the instructions.</p>
                                        <h5>Epilepsy </h5>
                                        <p>Theoretically, epilepsy has no obstacle to anesthesia or surgical
                                            intervention, however, a seizure that may occur during the operation may
                                            pose a life-threatening risk since it cannot be predicted when epileptic
                                            seizures will occur. Therefore, we recommend that they do not undergo any
                                            operation unless it is necessary.</p>
                                        <h5>Asthma </h5>
                                        <p>In the same way, asthma disease can be life-threatening in case of
                                            asymptomatic and unpredictable seizures during the operation, so we do not
                                            recommend any surgical intervention, except in mandatory cases.</p>

                                        <p>Although the minimum age limit for rhinoplasty operation varies slightly from
                                            person to person, we can generally say 16. The main reason for this is that
                                            the development is not yet complete. Changes made in a body
                                            that is not fully developed can cause the bones to fit incorrectly. In such
                                            cases, revision procedures may become obligatory and have negative
                                            consequences for both parties. Therefore, we do not recommend the
                                            operation under the age of 16 in the absence of severe trauma or
                                            psychological effects.</p>
                                        <h4>Is Rhinoplasty Performed After a Certain Age?</h4>
                                        <p>We talked about the lower limit for rhinoplasty, but is there an upper limit?
                                            There is no upper limit determined theoretically, however, after the age of
                                            60, the body starts to lose its power to regenerate itself.
                                            As a result of this situation, the scars do not heal at the desired level
                                            and it becomes difficult to achieve the desired results. Considering all
                                            these, we do not recommend any surgical operation after the
                                            age of 60, except for mandatory cases.

                                        <h4>Reasons of Wide Nose Structure</h4>
                                        <p>Although the wide nostrils cause breathing more easily in some cases, it can
                                            be at an aesthetically disturbing level. In such cases, the operation to
                                            reduce the nostrils can be performed. First of all, let's talk
                                            about the reasons why the nostrils appear wide. The first and main reason is
                                            of course genetics. If your family elders usually have such a situation, it
                                            is possible for you to have it too. Another reason is
                                            that the tip of the nose is low. If the nose tip height is not at the
                                            correct levels, the collapsed nose tip may cause the nose wings to appear
                                            wider. Another reason is that the tip of the nose is too raised.
                                            If the holes are visible from the front, this can be both visually
                                            uncomfortable and may show larger and larger nostrils than they are.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>How Is the Nostril Reduction Aesthetics Performed?</h4>
                                        <p>The reduction of the nostrils is usually one of the steps when nasal
                                            aesthetics are performed. However, if the individual requests only to reduce
                                            their nostrils, it is possible to respond to this demand. So how
                                            is this done? For this, if we are talking about a width that can be resolved
                                            by lifting the tip of the nose, the process is done by focusing on the tip
                                            of the nose, but if there is a width that cannot be resolved
                                            in this way or a situation that does not allow the nose tip to rise, then
                                            tissue removal is applied.

                                            due to genetic differences and age factors. 3-4 days for the swelling to
                                            disappear, 1 week for bruises and 1-2 months for edema are generally
                                            accepted times. These times are given on average and vary from person
                                            to person. We can say that you will see a completely settled nose at the end
                                            of 1-1.5 years.

                                        <p>Saddle nose deformity, known as boxer's nose, is the name given to the
                                            collapse of the partition between the root of your nose and the tip of your
                                            nose, which is at eye level, as a result of various reasons. Boxer's
                                            nose, which causes discomfort both aesthetically and functionally, is a
                                            problem that you can easily get rid of with surgical intervention. In

                                            nasal bone in the face of a strong blow can sometimes appear genetically.
                                            Nasal collapse, which can also be encountered after an unsuccessful very
                                            thin nose aesthetic operation, is a discomfort that can be saved
                                            under today's conditions.</p>

                                            should be reconstructed with cartilage taken from your body
                                            or otherwise supplied cartilage. Having your own cartilage may be to prevent
                                            infections that may ocur. Complications that may occur after the operation

                                            similar to the post-aesthetic operation. The nose should be carefully

                                        <p>There may be several different reasons for nasal deformity. These can be
                                            listed as genetic causes, heavy blows, and traumas. Distorted nose shape can

                                        <h4>What is Crooked Nose Operation?</h4>
                                        <p>The main reason for the curved nose problem is the heavy blows. If you have a
                                            crooked nose, it probably bothers you aesthetically and does not fully meet
                                            its functional requirements. A crooked nose brings problems
                                            such as breathing problems or inability to breathe from one side. Curved
                                            nose operation is called septorhinoplasty, in these operations curvatures,
                                            skews and deformities in the nasal bone are corrected. For
                                            the nose, it is possible to achieve both aesthetic beauty and to fully meet
                                            its functional requirements.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>What is Broken Nose Operation?</h4>
                                        <p>In the broken nose, the situations are a little different. As a matter of
                                            fact, completely damaged cartilages may not be used in some cases. In such
                                            cases, it may be the case that the cartilage structure taken from
                                            other parts of your body or otherwise obtained is placed in the nose.
                                            Fracture occurs as a result of heavy blows. Symptoms are often visible, but
                                            sometimes due to reasons such as bruising, swelling, and nasal
                                            congestion.

                                        <p>Smoking and alcohol consumption are actually products that should not be
                                            consumed not only after rhinoplasty, but after every operation. The reason
                                            for this is that smoking, and alcohol seriously affect and delay
                                            the healing process. When we look at the nose aesthetics in particular, the
                                            problems for smoking do not stop there. Continuous exposure to cigarette
                                            smoke increases the risk of infection. Another point to be
                                            considered is that one should not be in the environment as a passive smoker.
                                            Alcohol creates dryness on the skin as it will retain water in the body.
                                            This is a factor that prevents the healing of edema.This
                                            is a factor that prevents the healing of edema. For all these reasons, 1
                                            month before and 3 months after rhinoplasty operation
                                            <strong>smoking or any tobacco product should not be allowed. </strong>If
                                            possible, the patient should never smoke again. Alcohol consumption is
                                            recommended to be stopped for at least 3 weeks.

                                        <h4>First Week </h4>
                                        <p>The first days after a rhinoplasty operation may not always go well. After a
                                            surgical intervention, the body needs to get used to it, and the first
                                            reaction may be mild bruises and edema. Nasal congestion may be
                                            caused by edema in the nose for the first week, and this will disappear when
                                            edema subsides. In the first week, your nose will be covered with a tape and
                                            the nose will be supported with a nasal splint. At the
                                            end of the week, after the band is removed and the splint is removed under
                                            the supervision of the doctor, you will start to breathe more easily. Using
                                            the medications given by your doctor until this period will
                                            reduce your pain. If you do not have nausea after the operation, you can
                                            start consuming food and beverage after 4 hours. You can find the things
                                            that need attention or return to sports in our other articles.
                                            We recommend that you rest as much as possible during the first week.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Second week </h4>
                                        <p>You will start to meet yourself in the mirror at the beginning of the second
                                            week. Swelling around the nose will begin to return to normal and mild
                                            bruises will begin to disappear. Returning to your social life
                                            and workplace can start this week.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There are still some things to watch out for and avoid. For example, it is
                                            too early to return to your sports activities. You should stay away from
                                            heavy work. </p>
                                        <p>Although it is strange to say, you have to be careful not to laugh too much.
                                            As a matter of fact, it is necessary to be careful because laughing will
                                            cause you to change the nose area a lot.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, we recommend that you wear clothes that have buttons and can be
                                            buttoned up in order not to create a dangerous ground while wearing and
                                            taking off narrow-necked clothes.</p>
                                        <h4>End of First Month</h4>
                                        <p>Although the swelling and bruises have healed quite a lot, it is likely that
                                            you will not get rid of your edema at the end of the first month. For this
                                            reason, it is recommended that you stay away from salt, alcohol,
                                            carbonated and caffeine-based drinks for a while as much as possible. There
                                            may be a loss of sensation at the tip of the nose and this feeling will
                                            disappear over time.</p>
                                        <h4>2nd and 3rd Months</h4>
                                        <p>2 months have passed since your aesthetic operation. You can start your
                                            sports life slowly with the approval of your doctor. Unfortunately, not
                                            every sport can be start after 2 months. Among the sports where you
                                            may get a blow to your nose, such as ball sports (football, basketball,
                                            tennis, volleyball etc.) or combat sports are not suitable for this period.
                                            You can return to sports where contact is minimal, such as
                                            swimming and walking at a fast pace, with the approval of the doctor. Your
                                            edema will now be significantly reduced, and you can return to using glasses
                                            at the end of the 3rd month.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>6-12 months</h4>
                                        <p>After the 6th month, the restrictions will be largely eliminated. You will be
                                            able to switch to sports that are more likely to contact. However, it is
                                            necessary to be careful during the first year. As a matter of
                                            fact, it is a process that takes 1 year for the nose to fit properly. At the
                                            end of 1 year, you can say hello to a new you with your nose completely
                                            settled without any obstacles.

                                        <h4>Is Rhinoplasty Operation Among the Operations You Frequently Perform?</h4>
                                        <p> <strong>NK Clinic</strong> nasal aesthetics, which is our area of expertise,
                                            is an operation that we do very often. As a matter of fact, our doctor Nihat
                                            Kaya is specialized in Rhinoplasty with his experience of
                                            more than 10 years. </p>
                                        <p>You can ask your doctor for images of past operations and it will be useful
                                            to check their social media accounts to give confidence.</p>
                                        <h4>How Often Do You Need to Revise After Your Rhinoplasty Operations?</h4>
                                        <p>One of the worst scenarios that can occur after a rhinoplasty operation is
                                            the need for revision. In such cases, there will be very difficult times for
                                            the patient. To prevent this, you should ask your doctor how
                                            often they make revisions after rhinoplasty operations. The lower this
                                            figure in proportion, the better it will be. If the rate of revision is
                                            lower, it can be concluded that the surgeries performed are more
                                            successful.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Do You Use Simulation Before Rhinoplasty Operation?</h4>
                                        <p>Simulation is a must for nasal aesthetics. The reason for this is that it
                                            gives an idea of what kind of appearance the person will encounter after the
                                            operation. The simulation, which will make it easier for you
                                            to choose between the noses that fit your face, can sometimes show that the
                                            nose you want is not suitable for you.

                                        <h4>Which Associations and Societies Are You a Member of?</h4>
                                        <p>As in every field, there are organizations, associations and societies in
                                            which experts from all over the world are members in the field of plastic
                                            surgery. You can ask your doctor which associations and societies
                                            he is a member of. His answers can give you important previews.

                                        <h4>Do You Have Patients Coming from Abroad?</h4>
                                        <p>The fact that your doctor is known abroad as well as taking patients from
                                            abroad is an indication of your doctor's high reputation and success. You
                                            can ask your doctor how often he has foreign patients.</p>
                                        <h4>What Are My Options If I Am Not as Happy as I Expected with The Outcome?
                                        </h4>
                                        <p>The only treatment that can be done after unsatisfied aesthetic operations is
                                            revision operations. The assessment of the situation to be made on this
                                            subject is decided upon after talking between the individual
                                            and the doctor.

                                        <p>Septum deviation, known as the curvature of the nose, is the name given to
                                            the uneven cartilage structure that separates the two holes in the middle of
                                            the nose. Septum cartilage means deviation cartilage is not

                                        <h4>How Does Nose Curvature Occur?</h4>
                                        <p>Nasal curvature can occur mainly for two reasons. The first is that it occurs
                                            due to genetic reasons, the other is that it occurs as a result of the
                                            impacts received. In both cases, it can pose a problem both in
                                            terms of aesthetics and functionality.</p>

                                        <h4>What are the Physical and Functional Losses?</h4>
                                        <p>A nose that has difficulty breathing can bring many discomforts. For example,
                                            the body, which cannot get enough oxygen, constantly feels tired, the immune
                                            system does not work well and brings problems such as early
                                            fatigue. Lungs that cannot get enough oxygen for a long time may cause some
                                            lung problems in the following years.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>How Is Nose Curvature Surgery Performed?</h4>
                                        <p>The operation performed to correct the curvature of the nose proceeds similar
                                            to the nose aesthetics. Since each nose is different from each other, these
                                            differences will be examined, and a personal treatment method
                                            will be presented accordingly. </p>
                                        <p>While eliminating the deviation, deformities or nasal aesthetic operations
                                            can also be performed. When both are done together, an aesthetic and
                                            functional correction can be achieved. You should talk to your doctor

                                            when choosing a doctor. Because there is no room for error in thin
                                            skin.

                                        <p>The healing process of thin-skinned people is faster than those with thick
                                            skin. While the estimated recovery period is 6-12 months for individuals
                                            with thin skin, it is between 1-2 years for thick skinned individuals.</p>

                                            careful in choosing a doctor. As we mentioned before, the slightest mistake
                                            made in thin skinned skins will be visible.

                                        <p>Natural nose is a phenomenon that varies from person to person. There are
                                            many factors that affect this. Some of those;
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Ethnicity,</li>
                                            <li>Face type,</li>
                                            <li>Thin / Thick nose skin etc.</li>
                                            <p>Without considering these conditions, it is not possible to reach the
                                                natural nose.</p>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>As we mentioned in our best nose article, naturalness is among the conditions
                                            of a good nose. The clearest criteria to test the naturalness of nasal
                                            aesthetics is the comments made by individuals who have just entered
                                            your life about your nose. If she/he does not think that you have undergone
                                            any operation, you can infer that you have a successful and natural nose.

                                        <p>Although rhinoplasty operations are mostly desired by women, men rarely
                                            demand nasal aesthetics. Studies show that the demand for male candidates is
                                            rapidly increasing in percentage.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Aesthetically, this is actually not the case in terms of functionality. Male
                                            candidates also frequently undergo rhinoplasty surgery due to sleep
                                            problems, snoring and not being able to rest while sleeping.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Since sports branches that require a lot of contact, especially in childhood,
                                            are more common in men, trauma-induced nasal curvatures or fractures are
                                            generally seen in male candidates.</p>
                                        <p>Theoretically, nasal aesthetic operations in men are not different from
                                            women. Male patients are more prone to behave more comfortably, and this
                                            prolongs the healing process.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>How Should Rhinoplasty Be for Men?</h4>
                                        <p>The first criteria that can be said specifically for men is that the angle
                                            between the tip of the nose and the upper lip is 90 -95 degrees. Of course,
                                            this is not a necessity, but we can say that the angle value
                                            accepted in society is this way.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another point is that rhinoplasty operation should not be performed in men
                                            as well as women in an effort to resemble any celebrity. So, every face is
                                            different from each other and there are nose shapes suitable for each. We
                                            need to make sure that the
                                            nose you dream of is suitable for your face.

                                        <p>This can be in terms of aesthetics or functionality. However, we have to say
                                            that we recommend that you wait for at least 1 year after your previous
                                            operation. Because the fit of the nose will usually settle after
                                            1 year.

                                        <h4>What are the Differences of Primary / Secondary Rhinoplasty?</h4>
                                        <p>There are some differences between your first rhinoplasty, which we call
                                            primary, and your secondary operations.</p>
                                        <p>Failure of the first because of the doctor may scare you for a secondary
                                            operation. Don't be afraid, we're here!</p>
                                        <p>Revision rhinoplasty is much more difficult for both the doctor and the
                                            person than your primary operation. Most of the cartilage needs to be
                                            removed from the body. After the operation, the healing process will
                                            be longer and more difficult.</p>

                                        <h4>What is Piezo Rhinoplasty?</h4>
                                        <p>We can start by explaining what this concept is to give information about
                                            piezo nose surgery. Piezo surgical rhinoplasty is a method in which motor
                                            systems are used in the process of breaking the nasal bones with
                                            hammer and cutter during surgery, so that millimetric measurements can be
                                            made by seeing the nasal bones and postoperative swelling and bruising
                                            problems are minimal. Since bone cutting and shaping is done with
                                            motor systems in ultrasonic nasal aesthetics, the nasal bones can be seen in
                                            detail and can be cut with millimetric measurements. On the other hand, the
                                            ability to cut bones in a more controlled manner with
                                            piezo ultrasonic technique provides great benefits in achieving the targeted
                                            nasal structure. If we are to gather the information about what ultrasonic
                                            piezo nasal aesthetics is; Piezo nose surgery is a technology
                                            that allows the surgery to be more efficient. Bones are shaped by using
                                            ultrasonic sound waves in surgeries performed with this technology. Thanks
                                            to the tissue selection feature of the technology used in the
                                            operations performed with this technology, it does not damage the other
                                            tissue around the bones. Thus, less bleeding occurs during surgery. This
                                            provides less bruising and swelling after surgery. Therefore,
                                            those who have piezo nose aesthetics will have a more comfortable and
                                            convenient nasal surgery process.

                                        <h4>What is Micrometric Nose Aesthetics?</h4>
                                        <p>In this part of our article, we can also give information about micrometric
                                            nasal aesthetics. Micromotor technology is also a new technology and has
                                            been used in nose surgeries for about 10 years. In many fields
                                            from chin face surgery to neurosurgery, the micro-state of the motor
                                            technology used to shape the bone has been designed, allowing a very
                                            comfortable shaping surgery in small areas such as the nose. With micromotor
                                            technology, nasal bones can quickly provide a smooth shaping with an
                                            electrical energy-based system. Thanks to this pinpoint shaping, the
                                            possibility of edema and bleeding can be reduced, and thus a much faster
                                            wound healing period can be created. Therefore, again, less bruising and
                                            swelling is ensured. Micromotor rhinoplasty, which is among the techniques
                                            of rhinoplasty without breaking, allows sensitive intervention
                                            to deformities in the nasal bone through thin tips of an average length of 2
                                            mm connected to the micromotor device. Thanks to the fine tips in the
                                            micromotor technique, it is possible to intervene without applying
                                            force to the nasal bone. In this way, millimetric touches can be made on the
                                            nasal bone.
                                        <h4>How Is Ultrasonic Rhinoplasty Performed?</h4>
                                        <p>After answering the question 'What is piezo rhinoplasty? Ultrasonic
                                            rhinoplasty surgery can be performed under local anesthesia or general
                                            anesthesia. In piezo rhinoplasty, which lasts for an average of 1.5-2
                                            hours, a path is followed so that the soft tissues, nerves, vessels and
                                            mucosa in the natural structure of the nose are not damaged. Excessive
                                            bleeding or pain due to surgery is not expected, since large
                                            fractures in the nasal bone do not occur and do not cause infection. Thanks
                                            to the device used in piezo nose surgery, the doctor catches a more
                                            sensitive and easy working environment. Ultrasonic power generators,
                                            electronic module, while providing flexibility to the surgeon with its
                                            handpiece and tips, it also provides a faster and easier healing process
                                            with less damage to the patient. Therefore, nose surgery with
                                            piezo has many advantages for both the doctor and the patient. Therefore,
                                            those who undergo piezo rhinoplasty are especially advantageous in obtaining
                                            the nasal structure they want and removing edema.</p>

                                        <p>Rhinoplasty techniques differ in patients with thick skin compared to thin
                                            skins. The reason for this is that the details of the procedures performed
                                            are not seen much in thick skinned people. Thick skin covers
                                            the processes, so it is necessary to stretch the skin and use stronger
                                            cartilages. It is not easy to understand whether your skin is thick or thin.

                                            thick-skinned nose. After talking to your doctor, he or she will
                                            inform you about this. The healing process is longer in thicker skinned
                                            people than in thin skinned ones. The noses, which are expected to sit fully
                                            for up to 1 year under normal conditions, can last up to 2
                                            years due to thick skin.

                                        <h4>How Is Arched Nose Formed?</h4>
                                        <p>If your nose is arched, it is likely because of genes you have. Although it
                                            is more likely to occur due to natural reasons, an arched nose may rarely
                                            occur as a result of the impacts. There is no arching in newborns.
                                            Although the arched nose seems to be an aesthetic problem by many people, it
                                            can also cause frequent problems in terms of functionality. It has the same
                                            symptoms as most breathing problems, such as breath obstructions,
                                            inability to rest during sleep, and snoring. As a result of a detailed
                                            examination, you can find out the reason for your breathing problems.

                                        <h4>How to Fix?</h4>
                                        <p>The problem with arched noses is actually the protrusions in the nasal bone.
                                            A surgical intervention is necessary. These operations are also performed
                                            under general anesthesia. A nose with smooth lines is obtained
                                            by rasping the nasal bone. At the same time, the correct opening of the air
                                            ducts, the elimination of the factors that cause the obstruction, and if the
                                            patient wishes, aesthetic changes can also be made.

                                        <h4>How is nose tip surgery performed?</h4>
                                        <p>If only the nose tip is required to intervene, this operation takes less time
                                            than a normal nasal aesthetic. Since no action is taken on the bone
                                            structure, the bruises and swelling that will occur will heal much
                                            faster. Silicone support and nasal splint are also required after the nose
                                            tip operation. There will be no pain or pain when removing the buffer. The
                                            point that should not be forgotten for the final result is
                                            that the nose to fit looks natural and can meet its functional requirements
                                            without any problems.
